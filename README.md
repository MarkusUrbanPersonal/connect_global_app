### 1. The concept ‚òÄÔ∏è
Meeting people can be challenging, especially when travelling or attending events like Hackathons. 

This is where **Connect** is born, an app that makes the process of meeting new people much simpler, connecting people with similar interests.


### 2. How it works üì±

#### 1. Create an account
To join the app, the user is asked to fill some basic information.

#### 2. Join a group
The user can select the event that he's attending, that could be almost anything. There could even be groups for university classes, office employees or even neighbourhoods!

#### 4. Discover similar users
It's time to discover similar users. They can be searched and found on the app.

#### 5. Make new connections
In this case, as it's a Hackathon, interests related to programming have been added.

### The future ‚ú®
What about going one step further, and using *bluetooth* to actually connect users, as they're walking through common areas. The phone could display the common interests and conversation would start instantly.
