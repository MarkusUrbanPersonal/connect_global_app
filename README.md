A new way to connect with people 🧑‍🦱👩‍🦰👨👩🏾‍🦱🧑‍🦰

### 1. The concept ☀️
Meeting people can be challenging, especially when travelling or attending events like Hackathons. 
This is where **Connect** is born, an app that makes the process of meeting new people much simpler, connecting people with similar interests toghether. 

### 2. The parts 📱

#### A) Signup
To join the app, the user is asked to fill some basic information and is asked his main interests. 
This interests include main topics, but the list can be tailored to any specific event. 
In this case, as it's a Hackathon, interests related to programming have been added. 

#### B) User discovery
It's time to discover similar users. They can be searched and found on the app.

#### C) The future 🌐
What about making one step further, and using *bluetooth* to actually connect users, as they're walking through common areas. The phone could display the common interests and conversation would start instantly.
