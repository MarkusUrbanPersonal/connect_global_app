### **The concept** ☀️
Meeting people can be challenging, especially when travelling or attending events like Hackathons. This is where **Connect** comes in. 

### **How it works** 📱

#### **1. Create an account**
To join the app, you'll have to fill some basic information.

#### **2. Join a group**
After joining, you can select the event that you're attending, that could be almost anything. There could even be groups for university classes, office employees or even neighbourhoods!

#### **3. Select your interests**
This interests include main topics, but the list can be tailored to any specific event. There's also a search bar to find more interests.

#### **4. Discover similar users**
After adding your interests, other members with similar interests start to appear on the main screen. Hooray!

#### **5. Make new connections**
You can check your common interests and start a conversation. **Making new connections has never been easier!** ☀️

### Tech Stack
The web-app has been created using:
  
  🔵 **HTML**
  
  🟢 **CSS**
  
  🟨 **Javascript**
  
  ✨ **Flowbite** *(UI Components)*

  🐍 **Python** *(basic backend)*


### **The future** ✨
What about going one step further, and using *bluetooth* to actually connect users, as they're walking through common areas? The phone could display the common interests and conversation would start instantly. That is a future vision for this project. Until then, **Connect** is a great way to meet with new people at all kind of events.
